/* testfetch.c

 *	that fully utilizes HTTP Fetcher to implement a feature-rich HTTP download
 *	tool (available at http://fetch.sourceforge.net).

	 *	function you need (in conjunction with http_perror).  With HTTP Fetcher
	 *	you can also set User Agent, referer, and timeout values, parse
	 *	filenames, etc... see the header file (http_fetcher.h) for function
	 *	usage/information.
