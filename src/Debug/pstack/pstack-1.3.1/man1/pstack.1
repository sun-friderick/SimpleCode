.TH PSTACK 1 "Feb 25 2002" "Red Hat Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"

.SH NAME
pstack \- print a stack trace of running processes

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pstack
pid [...]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\f3pstack\f1 attaches to the active processes named by the \f3pid\f1s
on the command line, and prints out an execution stack trace,
including a hint at what the function arguments are.  If symbols exist
in the binary (usually the case unless you have run strip(1)), then
symbolic addresses are printed as well.

If the process is part of a thread group, then \f3pstack\f1 will print
out a stack trace for each of the threads in the group.

.SH RESTRICTIONS

\f3pstack\f1 currently works only on Linux, only on an x86 machine
running 32 bit ELF binaries (64 bit not supported).  Also, for
symbolic information, you need to use a GNU compiler to generate your
program, and you can't strip symbols from the binaries.  For thread
information to be dumped, you have to use the debug-aware version of
the LinuxThreads libpthread.so library.
(To check, run nm(1) on your pthreads library, and make sure that the
symbol "__pthread_threads_debug" is defined.)
Threads are not supported with the newer NPTL libpthread.so library.

.SH SEE ALSO
nm(1), ptrace(2)
